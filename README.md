WordFrikile is a Wordle clone, for geeks and freaks

WordFrikile is a Wordle clone with geek and freak vocabulary words.

It is programmed client-side in Vanilla Javascript, without any framework (except the use of [PequeJS](https://github.com/son-link/pequejs), my own library similar to JQuery).

On the server side I use Node.js with several libraries, but as with the client side I use Vanilla Javascript for the programming.

It's still in development phase, so there are still some things to implement and improve.
